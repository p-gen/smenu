.SH DESCRIPTION
This small utility acts as a filter when no input file is given
(reads from stdin and writes to stdout) or takes its inputs from that file.

All words read are presented in a scrolling window on the terminal \fBat
the current cursor position\fP, without clearing the screen first.
.PP
The selection cursor is initially positioned on the first selectable word
by default.
.PP
In this window, words can be displayed next to each other, with a fixed
size, or in rows or columns respecting the line ends as input.
In column mode, words can also be centred, left aligned or right aligned.
See the options \fB-C\fP|\fB-cs\fP|\fB-cols\fP|\fB-cols_select\fP,
\fB-R\fP|\fB-rs\fP|\fB-rows\fP|\fB-rows_select\fP and
\fB-al\fP|\fB-align\fP for more information.
.PP
There are options to explicitly or implicitly include/exclude or align words
using extended regular expressions.
Note that once certain words are explicitly excluded, they cannot be
re-included later.
.PP
Excluded words are skipped when the selection cursor is moved and cannot
be searched for.
.PP
The \fB-W\fP|\fB-ws\fP|\fB-wd\fP|\fB-word_delimiters\fP|\fB-word_separators\fP
option can be used to set the characters (or multibyte
sequences) which will be used to delimit the input words.
The default delimiters are: \fISPACE\fP, \fI\\t\fP and \fI\\n\fP.
.PP
The
\fB-L\fP|\fB-ls\fP|\fB-ld\fP|\fB-line-delimiters\fP|\fB-line_separators\fP
has a similar meaning for lines.

Special character sequences formed by a \fI\\\fP followed by one of the
characters \fIa\fP \fIb\fP \fIt\fP \fIn\fP \fIv\fP \fIf\fP \fIr\fP and
\fI\\\fP are understood and have their traditional meanings.

smenu strives to support UTF-8 encoding, both as input and output.
\fBUTF-8\fP sequences introduced by \fI\\u\fP and \fI\\U\fP are also
understood.

\fBWarning\fP, when used together, it is important to know that all
sequences beginning with \fI\\U\fP will be interpreted before the
beginning of the interpretation of sequences beginning with \fI\\u\fP.

\fI\\u\fP can be followed by 2,4,6 or 8 hexadecimal characters composing
an \fBUTF-8\fP bytestring.
Here is an example of using \fI\\u\fP to compose a \fBLatin Small Letter E
with Acute\fP: \fI\\uc3a9\fP.

\fI\\U\fP must be followed by exactly 6 hexadecimal digits, \fBincluding\fP
leading zeros, that represent a Unicode codepoint according to ISO
10646 UCS-4.
The \fBLatin Small Letter E with Acute\fP of the previous example
(codepoint \fBU+00E9\fP) can then be represented as \fI\\U0000e9\fP.
.PP
Note that with most shells, the \fI\\\fP before \fIu\fP and \fIU\fP
need to be protected or escaped.
.PP
Quotations (single and double) in the input stream can be used to ignore
the word separators so that a group of words are taken as a single entity.
.PP
Non printable characters in words that are not delimiters are
converted to their traditional form (\fI\\n\fP for end-of-line,
\fI\\t\fP for tabulation...) by default.
.PP
An invalid \fBUTF-8\fP sequence or other non-printable character will be
replaced by a dot (\fI.\fP) by default.
.PP
There is nevertheless a possibility to change this substitution character
with another \fBASCII\fP printable one with the help of the command line
option \fB-.\fP|\fB-dot\fP|\fB-invalid\fP.
.PP
\fBWarning\fP, \fBUTF-8\fP encoded codepoints are quietly converted
into the substitution character when the user locale is not \fBUTF-8\fP
aware like \fBPOSIX\fP or \fBC\fP by example.
.PP
Words containing only spaces, entered directly or resulting from a
substitution, are also rejected unless they are not selectable.
This allows special effects like creating blank lines for example.
These words are also kept in column mode, selectable or not.
.PP
smenu has an option to define a set of characters or \fBUTF-8\fP sequences
which should be ignored when reading words.
This can be very useful when dealing with inputs where the EOL sequence
consists in more than one character.
.PP
A typical example is DOS or Windows files with lines ending with
\fICRLF\fP.
In such a case one might decide to ignore all \fICR\fP characters from
the input.
.PP
.SS "Keyboard and mouse usage."
\fBkeyboard\fP:
.RS 2
The cursor can be moved in any direction using the arrow keys of the
keyboard: \fB\(<-\fP, \fB\(da\fP, \fB\(ua\fP, \fB\(->\fP
or the \fIvi\fP direction keys: \fBh\fP, \fBj\fP, \fBk\fP and \fBl\fP.
The \fBHOME\fP, \fBEND\fP, \fBPgDn\fP and \fBPgUp\fP keys can also be
used when available.

The meaning of the movement keys is as follows:
.TS
tab(@);
l l.
\fB\(<-\fP, \fBh\fP@Previous word
\fBSHIFT\ HOME\fP, \fBCTRL\ \(<-\fP, \fBH\fP@Start of line in column or line mode
\fB\(ua\fP, \fBk\fP@Previous line
\fBPgUp\fP, \fBK\fP@Previous page
\fBHOME\fP@First word of the window
\fBCTRL\ HOME\fP, \fBCTRL\ K\fP@First word
\fB<\fP@The window's content is shifted to the
@left while keeping the cursor visible

\fB\(->\fP, \fBl\fP@Next word
\fBSHIFT\ END\fP, \fBCTRL\ \(->\fP, \fBL\fP@End of line in column or line mode
\fB\(da\fP, \fBj\fP@Next line
\fBPgDn\fP, \fBJ\fP@Next page
\fBEND\fP@Last word of the window
\fBCTRL\ END\fP, \fBCTRL\ J\fP@Last word
\fB>\fP@The window's content is shifted to the
@right while keeping the cursor visible
.TE

\fBCTRL\ \(<-\fP/\fBH\fP (resp. \fBCTRL\ \(->\fP/\fBL\fP) places the cursor
so that a maximum number of words (selectable or not) are visible to
the left (reps. right) side of the window.

When the content of the window is shifted to the left or right using
\fB<\fP or \fB>\fP or the mouse, the cursor always highlights the same
word and remains visible.
This can prevent any further shifting operations.
.RE
.PP
\fBMouse:\fP
.RS 2
With many terminal emulators, it is possible to use the mouse to interact
with the screen content.

\fBWarning\fP, if groups of extended graphemes are present in the input,
mouse-based selection is only accurate if the terminal correctly displays
these graphemes.
An example of a non-functional terminal is xterm, an example of a
functional terminal is wezterm.

When the mouse is supported, the cursor can turn into an arrow (but
not always) and the mouse can then be used as a point and click device
as follows:

\fBFirst (usually left) mouse button (note that buttons can be remapped)\fP:
.RS 2
.IP \(bu 2
A click on a word selects it if it is selectable.
.IP \(bu 2
A click on a word while holding the CTRL key pressed when tagging/pinning
is activated marks/unmarks this word.
.IP \(bu 2
A Click at the ends of the vertical scroll bar (if present) is equivalent
to pressing the keyboard's up or down arrow.

A click anywhere else on the vertical scroll bar moves the cursor to
another word, depending on where you click.

The new current word will be positioned at the beginning of a line
if possible.

A click at the ends of the horizontal scroll bar (if present) is
equivalent to pressing the keyboard's left or right arrow.

A click anywhere else on the horizontal scroll bar moves the cursor left
of right on the line containing the cursor, but does not move it further
than the first or last word on that line.
.IP \(bu 2
A double-click on a word selects it, if selectable, and acts as if the
Enter key had been pressed, the double-click delay being configurable.
.IP \(bu 2
A click on the left or right horizontal arrow of each line (when visible)
shifts the content of the window to the left or right, one word at a time.
.br
Nothing happens if the cursor risks leaving the window.

Note that clicking on a left-facing arrow in an empty line means that
not all the words in that line could be displayed because of previous
shifts or moves.
In this case, smenu will try to display the last word of this line but
it is not always possible as the cursor must remain visible.
.br
The keyboard commands \fB<\fP and \fB>\fP can be used in such a case
because the cursor is already on the current line.
.RE
.P
\fBThird (usually right) mouse button\fP:
.RS 2
.IP \(bu 2
When tagging or pinning is enabled, a click on a word tags/untags it if
it is selectable.
.IP \(bu 2
When tagging or pinning is enabled, a click on a word while holding the
CTRL key pressed has the following actions:
.RS 2
.IP - 2
If the word clicked is selectable and no word is already marked then
marks it.
.IP - 2
If a word is marked and the clicked word is selectable and is not the
marked word, then:
.RS 2
.IP + 2
In column mode, if the marked word is in the same column/line as the
clicked word, tags all words bounded by those words in that column/line
as if \fBZ\fP the keyboard command were used.
.IP + 2
In line or column mode, if the marked word is in the same line as the
clicked word, tags all words bounded by those words in that line.
.IP + 2
Otherwise, tags all words bounded by the marked word and the
clicked one.
.IP + 2
In all cases, the mark is removed.

\fBMouse wheel\fP:
.RS 2
.IP \(bu 2
Rotating the mouse wheel scrolls the contents of the window one line up
or down.
.IP \(bu 2
Rotating the mouse wheel while holding down the \fBCTRL\fP key scrolls
the contents of the window one page up or down.
.br
This feature may not work depending on the terminal and operating system.
.PP
Be sure to use the wheel when the mouse pointer is over the smenu
window, as some terminal emulators may otherwise zoom the screen in
and out instead.
.RE
.PP
Remember that mouse support does not disable the keyboard, so use the
keys instead if the mouse is not working properly.
.PP
Some terminals may not report clicks after the 223rd line or column due
to a limitation of the old X11 mouse tracking protocol, one example of
such a terminal emulator is screen < 4.7.0.
tmux as well as screen >= 4.7.0 are fine.

Keyboard and mouse can be used at the same time.
.TP 2
\fBRemark 1.\fP
Some X-Window terminal emulators may not support the
enable/disable bracketed pastes escape sequence, in such a case if
may be necessary to explicitly clear the content of the paste buffer
before running smenu so that the mouse buttons (especially for pasting)
do their job correctly.
.br
This action can easily be performed using the command \f(CRxsel -c\fP
for example.
.TP 2
\fBRemark 2.\fP
Some X-Windows terminal emulators intercept mouse input
when some modifiers are used, a typical example is xterm which displays
popup menus in these cases.
.br
For xterm (Patch #361 - 2020/10/14 or later) a working workaround
is to use the X resource \f(CRXTerm*omitTranslation:popup-menu\fP
either by adding it in your \f(CR.Xresources\fP file and register
it with \f(CRxrdb\fP or by launching xterm using the
\f(CR-xrm 'XTerm*omitTranslation:popup-menu'\fP command line option.
.TP 2
\fBRemark 3 for BSD systems.\fP
In order for the mouse to work properly under (virtualised?) FreeBSD
and perhaps other BSD variants, it may be necessary add the following
two lines to the file \fB~/.Xmodmap\fP:

.nf
\f(CR! Disable button 8 and 9.
pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 10 11 12\fP
.fi

And run the command: \f(CRxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\fP
(ignore any warnings issued by this command).

This can also be done non-permanently by running the command:
.nf
\f(CRxmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 10 11 12"\fP
.fi

If this is not enough, try to disable buttons 8 to 12.

.RE
.P
\fBDirect access:\fP
.RS 2
If \fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP, \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP or
\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP are used, then it becomes
possible to directly access a word by entering its number.
The numbering created using these option is done \fBbefore\fP any words
substitution done using \fB-S\fP|\fB-subst\fP \fI/regex/repl/opts\fP,
\fB-I\fP|\fB-si\fP|\fB-subst_included\fP or
\fB-E\fP|\fB-se\fP|\fB-subst_excluded\fP.

Using a combination of these options, it is easy to control which words
will be numbered by adding a special symbol in it before using smenu and
removing it (substituted by nothing) afterward using
\fB-I\fP|\fB-si\fP|\fB-subst_included\fP by example.

\fB-E\fP|\fB-se\fP|\fB-subst_excluded\fP gives another way to do that,
see below or more.
.RE
.SS "Changing input words"
smenu offers the possibility to modify the input words in a sed-like way.
Words can be modified at two points: just after they have been read
and after other operations have been applied, such as enabling,
disabling or coloring.

The related options are \fB-ES\fP|\fB-subst\fP,
\fB-S\fP|\fB-subst\fP, \fB-I\fP|\fB-si\fP|\fB-subst_included\fP and
\fB-E\fP|\fB-se\fP|\fB-subst_excluded\fP their descriptions can be found
in the \fBOPTIONS\fP section.
.SS "Searching for words"
A word can be searched using different algorithms: \fIprefix\fP,
\fIsubstring\fP of \fIfuzzy\fP.
.TP
\fIprefix\fP (keys \fB^\fP or \fB=\fP):
The sequence of characters entered must match the beginning of a word.
.TP
\fIsubstring\fP (keys \fB"\fP or \fB'\fP):
The sequence of characters entered must match a substring in a word.
.TP
\fIfuzzy\fP (keys \fB~\fP or \fB*\fP):
All the characters in the entered sequence must appear in the same order
in a word, but need not be consecutive.

The case is also ignored.

Note that spaces and tabs at the beginning and end of words are ignored
when searching for substrings or fuzzy strings.

The cursor is placed, if possible, on the first matching word having the
minimum number of gaps between the first and last matching character,
see the difference between the actions of the \fBs\fP/\fBS\fP and
\fBn\fP/\fBN\fP keys below.

This method also tolerates intermediate symbols not appearing in the
words which will be ignored.
If this is the case, the attributes of the approximately matching
words are changed into an error versions of them to warn the user to
this situation.

The erroneous symbols will \fInot\fP be inserted in the search buffer.

For example: if the word \fBabcdef\fP is present in the standard input,
then entering \f(CBabxcdye\fP puts \fBabcdef\fP in the search buffer
and the word is added to the list of matching words and displayed with
an error attribute (in red by default).

This special state will persist until all the symbols following the first
erroneous one are deleted (using backspace) or if \fBESC\fP is pressed
to cancel the search session and clear the search buffer.
.PP
Note that, when searching, you can use the \fBTAB\fP key or the \fBCTRL\ I\fP
key sequence to try to auto-complete the search pattern, as in bash or ksh.
.PP
During a search session, the cursor changes and each character entered is
added in (or removed from) the search buffer.
The display is refreshed after each change in this buffer.
.PP
A 10 seconds timeout (by default) automatically ends the current
search session as if the \fBEnter\fP key had been pressed.
This timeout is reset each time a new key is hit in search mode.
This delay can be configured using the \fBsearch\fP entry in the
\fBtimers\fP section of the configuration file as shown in the example
in the configuration subsection.
.PP
The slash key (\fB/\fP) can also be used instead of any of these keys.
By default it is is programmed to do a \fIfuzzy\fP search but this can
be changed by using the command line option
(\fB-/\fP|\fB-search_method\fP) or by tuning a configuration file,
see below.
.PP
All the words matching the current search buffer are enhanced:
The characters present in the current search buffer are highlighted in
one way and the other characters in another way.
Both of these highlighting methods are configurable.
.PP
If the user has entered the search sequence: \fBo\fP, \fBs\fP, then the
matching word "words" will be displayed as \fBw\fP\fIo\fP\fBrd\fP\fIs\fP
when the \fIfuzzy\fP algorithm is in use depending of the display
attributes configured.
.PP
\fBENTER\fP and all cursor moves terminate the search session but do
not clear the list of the matching words and the search buffer.
.PP
The user can then use the \fBn\fP/\fBs\fP/\fBSPACE\fP keys (forward) and
the \fBN\fP/\fBS\fP keys (Backspace) to navigate in the list of matching
words,

When a \fIfuzzy\fP search has been performed, the \fBs\fP/\fBS\fP keys
attempts to move the cursor to the next/previous word whose matching part
forms a substring of consecutive glyphs.
.br
If no such matches exist, \fBs\fP/\fBS\fP and \fBn\fP/\fBN\fP are equivalent.
.br
\fBs\fP means next \fPs\fPubstring match in this context while \fBn\fP
just means \fBn\fPext match.
.PP
If the user hits the \fBHOME\fP or \fBEND\fP key during a search session
then the list of matching words is reduced to the words starting
(respectively) ending with the current search pattern and the window
is refreshed.
For those who consider \fBHOME\fP and \fBEND\fP as non-intuitive,
the \fBCTRL\ A\fP and \fBCTRL\ Z\fP keys are also available in search mode
as an alternative.
This behavior is persistent until the user hit the \fBESC\fP or
\fBENTER\fP key.

For example, if the search pattern in substring mode is \f(CBsh\fP and
the user hits \fBEND\fP, then only the words \fIending\fP with \f(CBsh\fP
will be added in the searched word list and enhanced.

Note that when a matching word is selected, its enhanced characters only
show one of the multiple matching possibilities.

When not in a search session \fBESC\fP can be also used to clear the
list of matching words and to reset the search buffer.
.PP
Note that the search buffer is persistent as long as the same search
algorithm is used and \fBESC\fP has not been pressed.
.SS "Selection and Exit"
Pressing \fBq\fP gives the possibility to exit without selecting anything.
.PP
\fBCTRL\ C\fP (Abort) also exits the program immediately with a return
code equal to 128+SINGINT (by default) without selecting anything.
See the \fB-!\fP|\fB-int\fP|\fB-int_string\fP option for more information
about the customization of the \fBCTRL\ C\fP behavior.
.PP
By default, \fBENTER\fP or a double click with the first mouse button if
applicable writes the selected word to stdout when not in
search mode otherwise it exits from this mode and does nothing more.
If you want to be able to select a word \fIeven\fP when in search mode,
use the \fB-r\fP|\fB-auto_validate\fP option to change this behavior.
.SS "Tagging (multiple selections)"
When the tagging is activated by using the command line
\fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP
or \fB-P\fP|\fB-pm\fP|\fB-pin\fP|\fB-pin_mode\fP option, then the
keys \fBt\fP, \fBu\fP, \fBINS\fP, \fBDEL\fP \fBc\fP, \fBr\fP,
\fBm\fP, \fBM\fP, \fBT\fP, \fBC\fP, \fBR\fP and \fBU\fP, can be
used to tag/untag some words.
These tagged words will then be sent to the standard output when
\fBENTER\fP is pressed.

Their meanings is as follows:
.TP
\fBt\fP
Tags/untags or Pin/unpin the word under the cursor (toggle).
.TP
\fBu\fP
Untags or unpins the word under the cursor.
.TP
\fBINS\fP
Tags or pins the word under the cursor.
.TP
\fBDEL\fP
Untags or unpins the word under the cursor.
.TP
\fBc\fP
Tags or pins all the selectable words in the current \fBcolumn\fP when
no word is marked, otherwise acts like \fBC\fP.
.TP
\fBr\fP
Tags or pins all the selectable words in the current \fBrow/line\fP
when no word is marked, otherwise acts like \fBR\fP.
.TP
\fBm\fP
Marks the current word, the cursor aspect will change until the word
is unmarked.
.TP
\fBM\fP or \fBESC\fP
Unmarks the current word, other actions will also automatically unmark
the word, see below.
.TP
\fBT\fP
If no word are marked and the result of a search is still displayed then
tags all words found in this search.

If no word has been searched and no word is marked, then the current
word is marked, just as if \fBm\fP has been used instead.
Otherwise all words between the marked word and the
current word are tagged.
.br
The marked word will no longer be marked after tagging is complete.
.TP
\fBZ\fP
Like \fBT\fP when not in search mode and when the marked words is not
on the same column or line as the cursor in column mode.
.br
When in column mode and if the marked word is in the same column or line
as the cursor, tags only the words in the same column (respectively line)
bounded by the marked word and the cursor.
.TP
\fBC\fP
As for \fBT\fP, \fBC\fP marks the current word if no word is currently
marked, just as if \fBm\fP had been used instead.
.br
If a word is already marked, \fBC\fP tags/pins the words between the
current and the marked words if they are the \fBsame column\fP.
.br
The marked word will no longer be marked after tagging is complete.
.TP
\fBR\fP
As for \fBT\fP, \fBR\fP marks the current word if no word is currently
marked, just as if \fBm\fP has been used instead.
.br
If a word is already marked, \fBR\fP tags/pins the words between the
current and the marked words if they are the \fBsame row/line\fP.
.br
The marked word will no longer be marked after tagging is complete.
.PP
Note that when you use \fBT\fP, \fBC\fP or \fBR\fP with pinning enabled,
the order of word selection depends on whether the marked word is before
or after the current word.
.br
When a word is marked, the pinning order using \fBc\fP and \fBr\fP
increases from the marked word to the current word.
.br
When no words are marked, the pinning order when using \fBc\fP and \fBr\fP
always increases from top to bottom and from left to right respectively.
.TP
\fBU\fP
Untags or unpins the last tagging action.
.TP
\fBCTRL T\fP
Untags all the previously tagged/pinned words.
.br
The marked word, if any, will no longer be marked after this action.
.PP
Also note that using some of these keys may be more easily achieved by
using the third mouse button (usually the right one) when the mouse
is available.
.br
See how to use the right mouse buttons in the "Keyboard and mouse
usage." at the beginning of this manual.
.SS Help
A small help message can be displayed when hitting the \fB?\fP key.
This message will last for 30s or until another key or \fBESC\fP is
pressed.
.br
If the help content is longer than the window, it can be scrolled up or
down using the vertical arrow keys or the vi direction keys (\fBj\fP
and \fBk\fP).
.SS "Scroll bars"
The vertical scroll bar is displayed at the right of the scrolling window.
Its appearance is meant to be classical but it has some particularities:
.IP \(bu 2
The vertical scroll bar is not displayed if all the input words fit on
only one line.
.IP \(bu 2
Otherwise, the vertical scroll bar is always displayed except when
the \fB-q\fP option is set.
This option completely disables the scroll display of all scroll bars.
.IP \(bu 2
When the scrolling window has only one line, the vertical scroll bar
has only 3 states:
.RS 2
.IP - 2
\fBv\fP when on all but the last line, indicating that you can go down
to see more.
.IP - 2
\fB^\fP when on the last line.
.IP - 2
\fB|\fP otherwise.
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
When there is more than one line to display, \fB/\fP means that the window
displays the first line, \fB\\\fP the last line.
\fB|\fP is used to fill the gap, see below the different possible
configurations.
.TS
tab(@);
l l l l l
l l l l l
l l l l .
\\@\\@^@^@\\ @Do not remove this trailing space!
|@|@|@|@/
/@v@/@v
.TE
.PP
A \fB+\fP can also appear in the scroll bar in lieu of the vertical bar,
giving the relative position of the cursor line in the bunch of input
words.

The horizontal scroll bar is only displayed below the window when the
current line is truncated in line of column mode.

If its appearance scrolls up the windows in the screen, the new position
of the window will unchanged even it this scroll bar is no more displayed
as the line containing the cursor is no more truncated.
.SS "Terminal resizing (also see BUGS/LIMITATIONS)"
The windows is redrawn if the terminal is resized.
The redrawing is actually done only 1s after the end of the resizing to
avoid artifacts on screen.
The cursor will remain on the current selected word but may be displayed
at another place in the window.
.SS "Unicode support"
This utility is Unicode aware and should be able to display correctly
any Unicode character (even double-width ones) as long as the current
encoding is \fBUTF-8\fP (\fBUTF-8\fP in the output of the \fIlocale\fP
command).

Note that smenu will not attempt to normalize words containing UTF-8 glyphs.
Thus \fI\\u61\\ucc88\fP (\fIä\fP) will not be considered equal to
\fI\\uc3a4\fP (canonical normalization of  \fIä\fP).
It is nevertheless possible to use an external tool such as uconv from the
ICU project (https://icu.unicode.org) to do this work before using smenu.

For example: uconv can be used as a filter as in:

\f(CBcat ... | uconv -x any-nfc | smenu\fP
.SS "Optional configuration file"
If a file with adequate permissions and the same name as the executable
but prefixed with a dot is present in the current directory
or in the user's home directory, then it will be parsed as a
\fI.ini\fP file.
The values read from the file in the home directory will be overridden by
the ones read from the local directory (if it is present).

Missing and bad keywords are silently skipped.

The values read, if valid, override the default hard-coded ones.

If a value is invalid an error message is shown and the program terminates.

The values of the timers must be given in units of \fB1/10\fP of a second.

Here is an example giving the syntax and the names of the keywords
allowed:

.IP \(bu 2
The \fBmethod\fP keyword can take the two possible values displayed
above and determines if you want to use the native method (limited to 8
colors) of the \fBansi\fP method (ISO 8613-6) if your terminal supports
more than 8 colors.

The default value corresponds to \fBansi\fP.

The attributes syntax is [fg][/bg][[,.+]toggles] where \fBfg\fP and
\fBbg\fP are numbers representing the foreground and background color
and \fBtoggles\fP is a strings which can contain the characters \fIb\fP,
\fId\fP, \fIr\fP, \fIs\fP, \fIu\fP, \fIi\fP, \fIn\fP and \fIl\fP
representing respectively \fIb\fPold, \fId\fPim, \fIr\fPeverse,
\fIs\fPtandout, \fIu\fPnderline, \fIi\fPtalic, i\fIn\fPvisible

.SH OPTIONS

Not all options may be available, depending on the current context.

When smenu is called and before the first option is evaluated, it is in
the \fBMain\fP context.
Each option can switch to another context in which only a subset of the
options is usable.

For each parameter described below, the contexts in which the associated
option is defined as well as the context to which it leads, if any,
are given.

An option not defined in a context will force the end of the current
context and will be recursively evaluated in the previous contexts until
found (or not).
If not found, an error message is displayed and smenu is terminated.

The contexts defined in smenu are:
.IP \fBMain\fP 2
The default context
.IP \fBColumns\fP 2
After the \fB-c\fP|\fB-col\fP|\fB-col_mode\fP|\fB-column\fP parameter.
.IP \fBLines\fP 2
After the \fB-l\fP|\fB-line\fP|\fB-line_mode\fP parameter.
.IP \fBTabulations 2
After the \fB-t\fP|\fB-tab\fP|\fB-tab_mode\fP|\fB-tabulate_mode\fP parameter.
.IP \fBTagging\fP 2
After the \fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP or
\fB-P\fP|\fB-pm\fP|\fB-pin\fP|\fB-pin_mode\fP parameter.
.PP
.IP \fBWARNING\fP 2
Here is a situation that may seem confusing at first glance.

Imagine the only parameter command line parameter is \fB-cols_select\fP.

Since this is a parameter of an option which is not valid when not in
the \fBColumns\fP context, it should have raised an error but it still
seems to be accepted.

The trick is: when not in column mode \fB-cols_select\fP is indeed not
accepted but its prefix (\fB-col\fP) is valid.
The options are thus understood as: \fB-col\fP \fB-s_select\fP.
The same mechanism occurs again as \fB-s\fP is also valid in column
mode so the final understanding of the command line is: \fB-col\fP
\fB-s\fP \fB_select\fP.

Another example that illustrates the fact that long parameters have
priority over short parameter combinations: \fB-is\fP will not select
only words containing a "\fBs\fP", but will act in the same way as its
alternative name (\fB-incremental_search\fP).

If you really want to select only words containing a "\fBs\fP", simply
add a space after the \fBi\fP as in \fB-i s\fP or use one of the other
\fB-i\fP names such as \fB-inc\fP for example.

In such cases, the user may set the \fBCTXOPT_DEBUG\fP environment
variable which any non-empty content.

If we reconsider the \fB-cols_select\fP example with \fBCTXOPT_DEBUG\fP set
the output is now:

.nf
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -cols_select. Evaluation context: Main.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Found a valid parameter as a prefix of -cols_select: -col.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -col. Evaluation context: Main.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Switch to context Columns.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -s_select. Evaluation context: Columns.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Found a valid parameter as a prefix of -s_select: -s.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -s. Evaluation context: Columns.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Argument: _select.
.fi

In this case, adding a space in the command line: \fB-col\fP
\fB-cols_select\fP \fB1\fP also solves the issue and indicates that only
the first column should be selectable.

Note, however, that at least one argument for \fB-cols_select\fP is
now required:

.nf
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -col. Evaluation context: Main.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Switch to context Columns.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -cols_select. Evaluation context: Columns.
CTXOPT_DEBUG: Argument: 1.
.fi
.PP
The \fB-h\fP|\fB-help\fP and \fB-?\fP|\fB-u\fP|\fB-usage\fP options now
display the help and synopsis of the available options in the current
context.
.IP Example: 2
\f(CBsmenu -col -u\fP will only show the usage in the \fBColumns\fP
context
.PP
The contexts contain all the non-context-changing options so, in practice,
the usage should be intuitive.
You may nevertheless have to adjust some scripts using the old smenu
releases as I did in the lvm_menu example.
.PP
Some of the advantages of this new system of options are:
.IP \(bu 2
Long parameter names are allowed
One dash is enough, but two are also allowed for compatibility reasons.
.IP \(bu 2
An option can be referenced by any number of parameters with short or
long names.
.IP \(bu 2
Auto checking of missing mandatory options, duplicated option,...
.IP \(bu 2
Only options usable in the current context are allowed.
.PP
This option management system is explained in more detail at
https://github.com/p-gen/ctxopt.
.PP
The description of each command line parameter is as follows:
.IP "\fB-h\fP|\fB-help\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Display a context specific help messages and exits.
.IP "\fB-H\fP|\fB-long_help\fP"
(Allowed in the "Main" context.)

Display a long (non context specific) help messages and exits.
.IP "\fB-?\fP|\fB-u\fP|\fB-usage\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Displays a short help message and exits.
.IP "\fB-V\fP|\fB-version\fP"
(Allowed in the "Main" context.)

The \fB.smenu\fP files in the user's home directory and in the current
directory, if present, will be ignored when this option is used.
.IP "\fB-n\fP|\fB-lines\fP|\fB-height\fP [\fIheight\fP]"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Gives the maximum number of lines in the scrolling selection window.

If \fB-n\fP|\fB-lines\fP|\fB-height\fP is not present the number of
lines will be set to \fI5\fP.

If \fB-n\fP|\fB-lines\fP|\fB-height\fP is present without argument, then
the height of the terminal will be used to determine the number of lines.
This remains true even if the terminal is resized.

If \fB-n\fP|\fB-lines\fP|\fB-height\fP is present with a numerical
argument, this value will be used to determine the number of lines.
.IP "\fB-i\fP|\fB-in\fP|\fB-inc\fP|\fB-incl\fP|\fB-include\fP... \fIregex\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Sets the \fBi\fPnclude filter to match the selectable words.
All the other words will become implicitly non-selectable (excluded)

\fB-i\fP|\fB-in\fP|\fB-inc\fP|\fB-incl\fP|\fB-include\fP can be used more
than once with cumulative effect.

\fI\\u\fP and \fI\\U\fP sequences can also be used in the regexp.
.IP "\fB-e\fP|\fB-ex\fP|\fB-exc\fP|\fB-excl\fP|\fB-exclude\fP... \fIregex\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Sets the \fBe\fPxclude filter to match the non-selectable words.
All the other selectable words will become implicitly selectable (included)

\fB-e\fP|\fB-ex\fP|\fB-exc\fP|\fB-excl\fP|\fB-exclude\fP can be used more
than once with cumulative effect.
This filter has a higher priority than the include filter.

The \fIregex\fP selections made using
\fB-i\fP|\fB-in\fP|\fB-inc\fP|\fB-incl\fP|\fB-include\fP and/or
\fB-e\fP|\fB-ex\fP|\fB-exc\fP|\fB-excl\fP|\fB-exclude\fP are done before
the possible words alterations made
by \fB-I\fP|\fB-si\fP|\fB-subst_included\fP or
\fB-E\fP|\fB-se\fP|\fB-subst_excluded\fP (see below).

\fI\\u\fP and \fI\\U\fP sequences can also be used in the regexp.
.IP "\fB-m\fP|\fB-msg\fP|\fB-message\fP|\fB-title\fP \fImessage\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Displays a message (title) above the window.
If the current locale is not \fBUTF-8\fP, then all \fBUTF-8\fP characters
will be replaced by the substitution character.

\fI\\u\fP and \fI\\U\fP sequences can be used in the message.

Note that the message will be truncated if it does not fit on a terminal
line.
.IP "\fB-!\fP|\fB-int\fP|\fB-int_string\fP [\fIstring\fP]"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

The optional \fIstring\fP argument, when present,
defines the string to be used as the selection string when
the \fBCTRL\ C\fP sequence is entered.

If \fIstring\fP is missing then nothing will be selected.

In all cases, when \fB-!\fP|\fB-int\fP|\fB-int_string\fP is present in
the command line, the return code of the program will be \fB0\fP.

This gives the user the choice to make the behavior of \fBCTRL\ C\fP
similar to that of \fBq\fP and \fBQ\fP or to that of the Unix shell
leaving the shell with a return code greater than 128.
.IP "\fB-a\fP|\fB-attr\fP|\fB-attributes\fP \fIprefix:attr\fP..."
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Sets the display attributes of the elements displayed and the cursor.

At least one attribute prefixed attribute must be given.

\fIprefix\fP can take the following values:
.RS
.PD 0
.IP \fIi\fP
included words.
.IP \fIe\fP
excluded words.
.IP \fIc\fP
cursor.
.IP \fIb\fP

.IP "\fB-9\fP|\fB-l9\fP|\fB-level9\fP \fIregex\fP [\fIattr\fP]"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Allows one to give a special display color to up to 5 classes of words
specified by regular expressions.
They are called \fBspecial levels\fP.
Only selectable words will be considered.

By default, the first 5 special levels have their foreground color set
to red, green, brown/yellow, purple and cyan and the remaining 4 levels
are set to white.
All these colors also can be set or modified permanently in the
configuration files.
See the example file above for an example.

The optional second argument (\fIattr\fP) can be used to override the
default or configured attributes of each class.
Its syntax is the same as the one used in the configuration file:
.nf
[\fIfg\fP][/\fIbg\fP]\
[,{\fIb\fP|\fId\fP|\fIr\fP|\fIs\fP|\fIu\fP|\fIi\fP|\fIn\fP|\fIl\fP}] \
| [{\fIb\fP|\fId\fP|\fIr\fP|\fIs\fP|\fIu\fP|\fIi\fP|\fIn\fP|\fIl\fP}]
.fi

Examples of possible attributes are:
.nf
  \f(CB2/0,bu \fPgreen on black bold underline
  \f(CB/2     \fPgreen background
  \f(CB5      \fPtext in purple
  \f(CBrb     \fPreverse bold
.fi

\fI\\u\fP and \fI\\U\fP sequences can be used in the pattern.
.IP "\fB-z\fP|\fB-zap\fP|\fB-zap_glyphs\fP \fIbytes\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Initializes a set of \fBUTF-8\fP characters to be ignored when reading
words from stdin or a file.

Example: The argument \f(CR'\\u0d\\ue282ac,'\fP means: ignore all commas,
Euro signs and carriage return characters when reading from stdin or
a file.

As shown above \fI\\u\fP and \fI\\U\fP sequences can be used in the
bytes set.
.IP "\fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP [\fIdelim\fP]"
(Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines", and
"Tabulations", switches to the "Tagging" context.)

Allows multiple selections and switches to \fBtag\fP mode.
In this mode, several selectable words can be selected without leaving
the program.

Tagged words are highlighted (underlined by default).

The current word can be automatically tagged when the \fBENTER\fP key
is pressed to complete the selection process if the
\fB-p\fP|\fB-at\fP|\fB-auto_tag\fP option is
also set or if no word has been tagged.

Note that nothing is selected when no word is tagged and when the
\fB-0\fP|\fB-noat\fP|\fB-no_auto_tag\fP option is also set.

All tagged words (and possibly the world under the cursor) will be sent
to the standard output separated by the optional argument given after
the option \fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP.

Note that the \fIdelim\fP argument can contain more than one character,
can contain \fBUTF-8\fP characters (in native or \fI\\u\fP or \fI\\U\fP
form) and can even contain control character as in \f(CB$'\\n'\fP.

A single space character is used as the default separator if none
is given.

\fBCaution\fP: To get exactly the same behavior as in version 0.9.11
and earlier, you must also use the \fB-p\fP|\fB-at\fP|\fB-auto_tag\fP
option.
.IP "\fB-P\fP|\fB-pm\fP|\fB-pin\fP|\fB-pin_mode\fP [\fIdelim\fP]"
(Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines", and
"Tabulations", switches to the "Tagging" context.)

Works like \fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP but, unlike
\fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP, the output depends on
the order in which the words were tagged.
In other words, the first tagged word comes first in the output, the
second tagged word comes next, and so on.
.IP "\fB-p\fP|\fB-at\fP|\fB-auto_tag\fP"
(Allowed in the "Tagging" context.)

This option modifies the default behavior of the
\fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP
and \fB-P\fP|\fB-pm\fP|\fB-pin\fP|\fB-pin_mode\fP options.

An untagged word under the cursor will be automatically tagged when
\fBENTER\fP is pressed.
.IP "\fB-0\fP|\fB-noat\fP|\fB-no_auto_tag\fP"
(Allowed in the "Tagging" context.)

This option modifies the default behavior of the
\fB-T\fP|\fB-tm\fP|\fB-tag\fP|\fB-tag_mode\fP
and \fB-P\fP|\fB-pm\fP|\fB-pin\fP|\fB-pin_mode\fP options.

An untagged word under the cursor will \fBnot\fP be automatically tagged
when \fBENTER\fP is pressed \fBand\fP no other words are tagged.
This is true even when the option \fB-p\fP|\fB-at\fP|\fB-auto_tag\fP is
also set.

It is ignored if at least one other word is tagged at that time.
.IP "\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP>da_ctx... [\fIregex\fP]"
(Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and
"Tabulation".)

This option allows you to number selectable words that match a specific
regular expression.
These numbers are numbered from 1 and allow direct access to the words.

To use this functionality, the user must enter the number which
corresponds to the desired entry digit per digit.

Each new digit must be added in a time frame of 1/2 seconds (per default)
otherwise the number is considered complete and a newly entered digit
will start a new number.
If the number does not exists, then the cursor is restored to it's
initial position.

The sub-options of the \fB-D\fP|\fB-data\fP|\fB-options\fP option
described below can change the way \fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP sets and
formats the numbers.

This option accepts more than one argument and can be used multiple
times with cumulative effects.

\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP, \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP and
\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP can be mixed.
.IP "\fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP>da_ctx... [\fIregex\fP]"
(Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and
"Tabulation".)

This option allows one to unnumber words.
If placed after a previous \fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP, it can be used to
remove the numbering of selected words.
If placed before, the word which doesn't match its regular expression
will be numbered by default.

This mechanism is similar to to the inclusion/exclusion of words by
\fB-i\fP|\fB-in\fP|\fB-inc\fP|\fB-incl\fP|\fB-include\fP and
\fB-e\fP|\fB-ex\fP|\fB-exc\fP|\fB-excl\fP|\fB-exclude\fP.

This option accepts more than one argument and can be used multiple
times with cumulative effects.

\fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP, \fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and
\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP can be mixed.
.IP "\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP"
(Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and
"Tabulation".)

This option is similar to \fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP but does not generate
a continuous flow of numbers but extracts them from the word itself.

With this option you can take full control of the numbering of the
displayed word.
Note that the numbering does not need to be ordered.

The resulting word after the extraction of the number must be non empty.

Some sub-option are required, see the \fB-D\fP|\fB-data\fP|\fB-options\fP
option described below.

\fBNotice\fP that for this option to work correctly, all the embedded
numbers must have the same number of digits.
To get that, a preprocessing may be necessary on the words before using
this program.

\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and
\fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP can be mixed.
.IP "\fB-D\fP|\fB-data\fP|\fB-options\fP [\fIparameter\fP...]"
(Allowed in the Following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and
"Tabulations".)

This option allows one to change the default behavior of
the \fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP, \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP and
\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP options.

Its optional parameters are called sub-options and must respect the
format \fBx\fP:\fBy\fP where \fBx\fP can be:
.RS
.TP
\f(CBl\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP is the \fBUTF-8\fP character (in native or \fI\\u\fP or
\fI\\U\fP form) to print before the number.
The default is a single space.

Example:
.br
\f(CRecho test | smenu -N -D l:\\(\fP
.br
Will display: '\f(CB(1)\f(CR test\fR'
.
.TP
\f(CBr\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP is the \fBUTF-8\fP character (in native or \fI\\u\fP or
\fI\\U\fP form) to print after the number.
The default is \f(CB)\fP.

Example:
.br
\f(CRecho test | smenu -N -D r:\\>\fP
.br
Will display: ' \f(CB1>\f(CR test\fR'
.
.TP
\f(CBa\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP is '\f(CBleft\fP' (or one of its prefixes) if the number
must be \fIleft\fP aligned, or '\f(CBright\fP' (or one of its prefixes)
if it must be \fIright\fP aligned.
The default is \f(CBright\fP.

Example:
.br
\f(CRecho test | smenu -N -D a:right w:3\fP
.br
Will display: '   \f(CB1)\f(CR test\fR'

\f(CRecho test | smenu -N -D a:left w:3\fP
.br
Will display: ' \f(CB1  )\f(CR test\fR'
.
.TP
\f(CBp\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP is '\f(CBincluded\fP' or '\f(CBall\fP' for the initial
\fIp\fPadding of the non numbered words.
The keyword '\f(CBincluded\fP' means that only \fIincluded\fP word will
be padded while '\f(CBall\fP' means pad \fIall\fP words.

This sub-option may improve compactness when there is a lot of
non-selectable words.

The default is \f(CBall\fP. These keywords can be abbreviated.

\fBWARNING\fP: in column/line/tab mode this sub-option is ignored and
non numbered words are always padded.

Example:
.br
\f(CRecho a b c | smenu -eb -N -D l:\\( p:a\fP
.br
Will display:
\f(CB(1)\f(CR a     b \f(CB(2) c\fR

.br
\f(CRecho a b c | smenu -eb -N -D l:\\( p:i\fP
.br
Will display:
\f(CB(1)\f(CR a b \f(CB(2) c\fR
.
.TP
\f(CBw\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP is the \fIw\fPidth of the number between 1 and 5 included.

For an example, refer to the sub-option \fBa\fP above.
.
.TP
\f(CBf\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP controls if the numbering must \fIf\fPollow the last
extracted number (defaults to \f(CByes\fP) or if it must remain
independent.

The possible values are \f(CByes\fP and \f(CBno\fP but can be abbreviated.

Example:
.br
\f(CRecho 2a b c | smenu -F -D l:\\( f:n n:1 -N\fP
.br
Will display:
\f(CB(2)\f(CR a \f(CB(1)\f(CR b \f(CB(2)\f(CR c\fR

.br
\f(CRecho 2a b c | smenu -F -D l:\\( f:y n:1 -N\fP
.br
Will display:
\f(CB(2)\f(CR a \f(CB(3)\f(CR b \f(CB(4)\f(CR c\fR
.
.TP
\f(CBm\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP option)
Here \fBy\fP controls if the numbering of word with missing embedded numbers
must be done or not (defaults to \f(CByes\fP).

When this sub-option is set to \f(CBno\fP, the \f(CBs\fP and \f(CBf\fP
sub-options are ignored.

The possible values are \f(CByes\fP and \f(CBno\fP but can be abbreviated.
.
Example:
.br
\f(CRecho 2a b c | smenu -F -D l:\\( n:1 m:n -N\fP
.br
Will display:
\f(CB(2)\f(CR a     b     c\fR

\f(CRecho 2a b c | smenu -F -D l:\\( n:1 m:y -N\fP
.br
Will display:
\f(CB(2)\f(CR a \f(CB(3)\f(CR b \f(CB(4)\f(CR c\fR
.TP
\f(CBh\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP option)
Tells what to do with the characters present before the embedded number if
any.

The allowed directives are: '\f(CBtrim\fP' which discards them if they
form an empty word (only made of spaces and tabulations), '\f(CBcut\fP'
which unconditionally discards them and '\f(CBkeep\fP' which places them
at the beginning of the resulting word.

The default value for this directive is '\f(CBkeep\fP', these keywords
can be abbreviated.

Example:
.br
\f(CBecho \\" 2x\\" | smenu -F -D l:\\( o:1 n:1\fR
.br
Will display:
.br
\f(CB(2)\f(CR  x\fR
\f(CR    ^^\fR
\f(CB    \fRSelection cursor

\f(CBecho \\" 2x\\" | smenu -F -D l:\\( o:1 n:1 h:t\fR
.br
Will display:
.br
\f(CB(2)\f(CR x\fR
\f(CR    ^\fR
\f(CB    \fRSelection cursor

\f(CBecho \\"x2y\\" | smenu -F -D l:\\( o:1 n:1 h:c\fR
.br
Will display:
.br
\f(CB(2)\f(CR y\fR
.
.TP
\f(CBo\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP option)
Here \fBy\fP is the \fIo\fPffset of the first multibyte character of
the number to extract from the word (defaults to \f(CB0\fP).

If this offset if immediately followed by the character '\f(CB+\fP',
then the parser will look for the first number (if any) after the given
offset instead of using its absolute value to extract the number.

Note that when the '\f(CB+\fP' is used, it is necessary that the length
of all the numbers to extract have the same size as the algorithm looks
for a digit to identify the beginning of the number to extract.
Hence, for example, \fB1\fP should appear as \fB01\fP in the input is
\f(CBn\fP is set to \f(CB2\fP.

Example:
.br
\f(CBecho x2y xx3y | smenu -F -D l:\\( o:1+ n:1\fR
.br
will display:
.br
\f(CB(2)\f(CR xy \f(CB(3)\f(CR xxy\fR

\f(CBecho x2y xx3y | smenu -F -D l:\\( o:1 n:1\fR
.br
will display (note the absence of the '\f(CB+\fP' character):
.br
\f(CB(2)\f(CR xy     xx3y\fR
.
.TP
\f(CBn\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP option)
Here \fBy\fP is the \fIn\fPumber of multibyte characters to extract
from the word starting at the offset given by the \f(CBo\fP sub-option.

Example: \f(CRn:2\fP will extract and use the first 2 digits of each
words from the input stream to number them.

.TP
\f(CBi\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP option)
Here \fBy\fP is number of multibyte characters to \fIi\fPgnore after
the extracted number
.
.TP
\f(CBd\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP is a multibyte separator.
When present, this directive instructs smenu to output the selected
numbered word(s) \fIprefixed\fP by its(their) direct access number(s)
and the given separator.

Only the numbered word(s) will be prefixed.

\f(CBd\fP stands for \fBd\fPecorate.

This directive can be useful when you want to post-process the output
according to its direct access number.

Example:
.br
\f(CBR=$(echo a b c | smenu -N -D d:-)\fR
.br
will display:
.br
\f(CB1)\f(CR a  \f(CB2)\f(CR b  \f(CB3)\f(CR c\fR
.br
The variable \f(CBR\fP will then contain the string \f(CB2-b\fP if
\f(CBb\fP is selected.
.
.TP
\f(CBs\fP (\fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP, \
\fB-N\fP|\fB-number\fP and \fB-U\fP|\fB-unnumber\fP options)
Here \fBy\fP is the direct access number that will be set for the first
numbered word.
Its value is \fB1\fP by default, a value of \fB0\fP is possible.

Example:
.br
\f(CBecho a b c | smenu -N -D s:1000\fR
.br
will display:
.br
\f(CB1000)\f(CR a  \f(CB1001)\f(CR b  \f(CB1002) c\fR
.P
To number all words with the default parameters, use the
syntax: "\f(CR-N\fP" which is a shortcut for:
"\f(CR-N -D l:' ' r:')' a:r p:a\fP"

When the \f(CBw\fP sub-option is not given, the width of the numbers is
determined automatically but if \fB-F\fP|\fB-en\fP|\fB-embedded_number\fP
is set and the value of the \f(CBn\fP sub-option is given then this
value is used.
.RE
.IP "\fB-b\fP|\fB-blank\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Replaces all non-printable characters by a blank.
If this results in a blank word, it will be potentially deleted.
.IP "\fB-.\fP|\fB-dot\fP|\fB-invalid\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Sets the substitution character for non-printable characters.
When this parameter is not used, the default substitution character is
a single dot.
.IP "\fB-M\fP|\fB-middle\fP|\fB-center\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Centers the display if possible.
.IP "\fB-d\fP|\fB-restore\fP|\fB-delete\fP|\fB-clean\fP|\fB-delete_window\fP|\
\fB-clean_window\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Tells the program to clean up the display before quitting by removing
the selection window after use as if it was never displayed.
.IP "\fB-c\fP|\fB-col\fP|\fB-col_mode\fP|\fB-column\fP"
(Allowed in the "Main" and "Tagging" contexts, switches to the "Columns"
context.)

Sets the column mode.
In this mode the lines of words do not wrap when the right border of
the terminal is reached but only when a special character is read.
Some words will not be displayed without an horizontal scrolling.

If such a scrolling is needed, some indications may appear on the left
and right edge of the window to help the user to reach the unseen words.

In this mode, the width of each column is minimal to keep the maximum
information visible on the terminal.
.IP "\fB-l\fP|\fB-line\fP|\fB-line_mode\fP"
(Allowed in the "Main" and "Tagging" contexts, switches to the "Lines"
context.)

Sets the line mode.
This mode is the same as column mode but without any column alignment.
.IP "\fB-t\fP|\fB-tab\fP|\fB-tab_mode\fP|\fB-tabulate_mode\fP [\fIcols\fP]"
(Allowed in the "Main" and "Tagging" contexts, switches to the
"Tabulations" context.)

This option sets the tabulation mode and, if a number is specified,
attempts to set the number of displayed columns to that number.

In this mode, embedded line separators are ignored if not explicitly set
with \fB-L\fP|\fB-ls\fP|\fB-ld\fP|\fB-line-delimiters\fP|\fB-line_separators\fP.
The options \fB-A\fP|\fB-fc\fP|\fB-first_column\fP and
\fB-Z\fP|\fB-lc\fP|\fB-last_column\fP can nevertheless be used to
force words to appear in the first (respectively last) position of the
displayed line.
.PP
.RS
Note that the number of requested columns will be automatically reduced
if a word does not fit in the calculated column size.
.PP
In this mode each column has the same width.
.RE
.IP "\fB-w\fP|\fB-wide\fP|\fB-wide_mode\fP"
(Allowed in the "Columns" and "Tabulations" contexts.)

When \fB-t\fP|\fB-tab\fP|\fB-tab_mode\fP|\fB-tabulate_mode\fP is followed
by a number of columns, the default is to compact the columns so that they
use the less terminal width as possible.
This option enlarges the columns in order to use the whole terminal width.

When in column mode, \fB-w\fP|\fB-wide\fP|\fB-wide_mode\fP can be used
to force all the columns to have the same size (the largest one).
See option \fB-c\fP|\fB-col\fP|\fB-col_mode\fP|\fB-column\fP below.
.PP
.RS
Note that the column's size is only calculated once when the words are
displayed for the first time.
A terminal resize will not update this value.
This choice enables a faster display.

\fIa\fP|\fIA\fP]\
[\fIselectors\fP]..."
(Allowed in the "Columns" context.)

In column mode, this option is useful for performing specific actions
on a set of columns.

These actions varies according to the directive given:
.br
- You can include (directive \fIi\fP or \fII\fP) or exclude (\fIe\fP or
\fIE\fP) a set of selectable columns.
.br
- You can specified the kind of alignment (left, right or center) of the
set of columns with the directives \fIl\fP, \fIL\fP, \fIr\fP, \fIR\fP,
\fIc\fP or \fIC\fP.
.br
- You can also specified the attributes (colors...) of the set of columns
with the directives \fIa\fP or \fIA\fP.

When the directive is missing, the "include" directive is assumed
(\fIi\fP).

Note that it is best to use the lower case version of these directives,
as their upper case alternative may have other meanings in the future.

In selectors, columns can be designated by their number (starting with
1) or by regular expressions surrounded by delimiters consisting of
any printable ASCII character, except spaces and unprotected commas;
commas can be protected by backslashes ('\fCD\\\fP')).

Column ranges are defined  by separating their numbers with a dash. Open
interval to the left or right are allowed, so these interval descriptions
may be preceded or followed by a dash (e.g. \f(CB5-7\fP, \f(CB-2\fP
or \f(CB8-\fP are allowed).

\fBWARNING\fP: ranges of regular expressions are not yest supported.

When using the \fIa\fP|\fIA\fP directive, an attribute \fBmust\fP be
appended prefixed by a colon (':') as in \f(CB-C a1-2:6+b\fP per example.
Refer to the attribute option (\fB-a\fP|\fB-attr\fP|\fB-attributes\fP)
for more details.

Multiple selectors can be regrouped in one argument using commas to
separate them.

This option also accepts multiple arguments, each of them being a
selector.

A selection by regular expressions means that a column containing a word
matching any of these expressions will be included or excluded depending
on the letter given after the option or before the selector if there is
more than one argument.

Regular expressions and column numbers can be freely mixed.

This option also sets the default alignment of column contents when no
arguments are provided.
For example: \f(CB-Cr -Cl1\fP sets the default alignment to the right
and the alignment of the contents of column 1 to the left.
At the beginning, no default alignment of the column contents is set.

Regular expression in \fB-C\fP|\fB-cs\fP|\fB-cols\fP|\fB-cols_select\fP and
\fB-R\fP|\fB-rs\fP|\fB-rows\fP|\fB-rows_select\fP can contain \fBUTF-8\fP
characters either directly or by using the \fI\\u\fP or \fI\\U\fP notation.

Example of columns selection: \f(CB-Ci2,3,/X./,5-7\fP forces the cursor
to only navigate in columns \fB2\fP,\fB3\fP,\fB5\fP,\fB6\fP and \fB7\fP
and those containing a two characters word starting with '\fBX\fP'.
If \fIe\fP was used in place of \fIi\fP, all the columns would have been
selected \fBexcept\fP the columns \fB2\fP,\fB3\fP,\fB5\fP,\fB6\fP,\fB7\fP
and those matching the extended regular expression '\f(CBX.\fP'.

Example of defining the attributes of a column set:
\f(CB-C a2-6:7/4+b\fP forces the columns from 2 to 6 to be bold and have
a foreground color equal to 7 and a background color equal to 4.

Example of mixing alignment and inclusion/exclusion directives:
\f(CB-Ci1-5 -Ce/a+/ -Cr7,/b+/\fP makes columns 1 to 5 selectable, makes
columns whose content starts with "a" non selectable and aligns the
content of the column 7 to the left.

Spaces are allowed in the selection string if they are protected.

When an alignment directive is used and without any column selection,
then the specified alignment becomes the default one, E.g: \f(CB-Cr\fP
sets alignment the default one to the right.

Other example where multiple selectors are used as multiple arguments:
\f(CBps | smenu -col -cols e/TTY/ e/CMD/ e3\fP

\fBWarning\fP, if this option appears on the command line before any
\fB-R\fP|\fB-rs\fP|\fB-rows\fP|\fB-rows_select\fP option, the specified
column alignments will be protected from any future row alignment
directives.
Otherwise row alignment directives will take precedence. For example:

\f(CBecho "a b c\\\\naa bb cc\\\\naaaa bbbb cccc"
| smenu -c -g\\| -C c2 -R r2\fP
.br
.nf
Gives:
\f(CRa   | b  |c\fP

But
\f(CBecho "a b c\\\\naa bb cc\\\\naaaa bbbb cccc"
| smenu -c -g\\| -R r2 -C c2\fP
.br
.nf
Gives:
\f(CRa   | b  |c\fP
\f(CR  aa|  bb|  cc <-- -R\fP takes precedence as it was used first.
\f(CRaaaa|bbbb|cccc\fP
.fi
.IP "\fB-R\fP|\fB-rs\fP|\fB-rows\fP|\fB-rows_select\fP... \fIselectors\fP..."

Similar to \fB-C\fP|\fB-cs\fP|\fB-cols\fP|\fB-cols_select\fP but for
the rows.

\fBWarning\fP, the directives \fIl\fP, \fIL\fP, \fIr\fP, \fIR\fP, \fIc\fP
and \fIC\fP are only allowed in column mode.

\fB-C\fP|\fB-cs\fP|\fB-cols\fP|\fB-cols_select\fP and
\fB-R\fP|\fB-rs\fP|\fB-rows\fP|\fB-rows_select\fP can be used more than
once in a cumulative manner:

The selection mode (selection or de-selection) is given by the first
occurrence of the options, the other occurrences will only update the
selected or de-selected ranges.

Once a column or a row has been excluded, it cannot be re-included.
.IP "\fB-al\fP|\fBalign\fP... \fIregex_selectors\fP..."
(Allowed in the "Columns" context.)

This option is similar to
\fB-C\fP|\fB-cs\fP|\fB-cols\fP|\fB-cols_select\fP and
\fB-R\fP|\fB-rs\fP|\fB-rows\fP|\fB-rows_select\fP but allows to
align all words matched by on of the regular expression defined in
\fIregex_selectors\fP

This option only accepts a list of regular expressions.

E.g.: \f(CB-al c/a+/,/b+/\fP

\fB-al\fP|\fBalign\fP,
\fB-C\fP|\fB-cs\fP|\fB-cols\fP|\fB-cols_select\fP and
\fB-R\fP|\fB-rs\fP|\fB-rows\fP|\fB-rows_select\fP can be used more than
once in a cumulative manner.

Word alignments with this option take precedence over row and column
alignments.
.IP "\fB-A\fP|\fB-fc\fP|\fB-first_column\fP \fIregex\fP"
(Allowed in the following contexts: "Columns", "Lines" and "Tabulations".)

In column mode, forces all words matching the given regular expression

.RE
.IP "\fB-g\fP|\fB-gutter\fP [\fIstring\fP]"
(Allowed in the "Columns" and "Tabulations" contexts.)

Replaces the blank after each words in column or tabular mode by a column
separator.

This separator is extracted from the \fIstring\fP argument and each
of its (multibyte) character is used one after the other to fill
the gutter.

If there are more columns that gutter characters then the last character
is used for the remaining columns.

When not given, the separator defaults to a vertical bar \fI|\fP (or a
full height vertical bar if the locale is set to \fBUTF-8\fP).

Each character can be given in normal or \fI\\u\fP or \fI\\U\fP form in
the \fIstring\fP argument.

Example: "\f(CB|- \fP" will allow one to separate the first two columns
with '\f(CB|\fP', then '\f(CB-\fP' will be used and '\f(CB \fP' will
separate the remaining columns if any.
.IP "\fB-k\fP|\fB-ks\fP|\fB-keep_spaces\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

By default, the spaces surrounding the output string will be deleted.
This option forces them to be retained.
.IP "\fB-W\fP|\fB-ws\fP|\fB-wd\fP|\fB-word_delimiters\fP|\
\fB-word_separators\fP \fIbytes\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

This option can be used to specify the characters (or multibyte
sequences) which will be used to delimit the input words.

Each character or multibyte sequence in the given argument will be
understood as a word delimiter.

Multibyte sequences (\fBUTF-8\fP) can be natives of using the same ASCII
representation used in words (a leading \fI\\u\fP or \fI\\U\fP following
by up to 8 hexadecimal characters for the former and 6 hexadecimal
characters for the latter).

Non-printable characters in arguments should be given using the standard
\fI$''\fP representation.
\fI$'\\t'\fP stands for the tabulation character for example.

The default delimiters are: \fISPACE\fP, \fI$'\\t'\fP and \fI$'\\n'\fP.
.IP "\fB-L\fP|\fB-ls\fP|\fB-ld\fP|\fB-line-delimiters\fP|\
\fB-line_separators\fP \fIbytes\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

This option can be used to specify the characters (or multibyte
sequences) which will be used to delimit the lines in the input stream.

Each character or multibyte sequence in the given argument will be
understood as a line delimiter.

Multibyte sequences (\fBUTF-8\fP) can be natives of using the same ASCII
representation used in words (a leading \fI\\u\fP or \fI\\U\fP following
by up to 8 hexadecimal characters for the former and 6 hexadecimal
characters for the latter).

Non-printable characters in arguments should be given using the standard
$'' representation.
$'\\n' stands for the newline character for example.

The default delimiter is: \fI$'\\n'\fP.

This option is only useful when the
\fB-c\fP|\fB-col\fP|\fB-col_mode\fP|\fB-column\fP or \fB-l\fP option is
also set.

The characters (or multibyte sequences) passed to
\fB-L\fP|\fB-ls\fP|\fB-ld\fP|\fB-line-delimiters\fP|\fB-line_separators\fP are
automatically added to the list of word delimiters as if
\fB-W\fP|\fB-ws\fP|\fB-wd\fP|\fB-word_delimiters\fP|\fB-word_separators\fP was
also used.

\fI\\u\fP and \fI\\U\fP sequences can also be used here.
.TP
.IP "\fB-q\fP|\fB-no_bar\fP|\fB-no_scroll_bar\fP"

Prevents the display of the lateral scroll bar.
This also prevents the display of the horizontal scroll bar.
.IP "\fB-no_hbar\fP|\fB-no_hor_scroll_bar\fP"
(Allowed in the "Columns" and "Lines" contexts.)

Prevents the display of the horizontal scroll bar.
.IP "\fB-hbar\fP|\fB-hor_scroll_bar\fP"
(Allowed in the "Columns" and "Lines" contexts.)

Forces the display of the horizontal scroll when at least one line will be
truncated.
This is the case even if the current line or lines being currently
displayed are not truncated.

When the \fB-no_hbar\fP|\fB-no_hor_scroll_bar\fP or
\fB-q\fP|\fB-no_bar\fP|\fB-no_scroll_bar\fP are also present then this
option is ignored.
.IP "\fB-S\fP|\fB-subst\fP... \
/\fIregex\fP/\fIrepl\fP/[\fIg\fP][\fIv\fP][\fIs\fP]"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Post-processes the words by applying a regular expression based
substitution.
The argument must be formatted as in the \fBsed\fP editor.

As in \fBsed\fP, matching groups and references to these groups
(from \f(CB\\0\fP to \f(CB\\9\fP in \fIrepl\fP) are supported.
These groups must be surrounded by \f(CB(\fP and \f(CB)\fP in \fIregex\fP.
\f(CB\\0\fP and \f(CB&\fP are equivalent in \fIrepl\fP as in the GNU
version of \fBsed\fP.

Back reference example:

.nf
\f(CBR=$(echo "[A] [B] [C]" | ./smenu -S '/([^][]+)/:\\1:/')\fP
will display \f(CR"[:A:] [:B:] [:C:]"\fP
.fi

This option can be used more than once.
Each substitution will be applied in sequence on each word.
This sequence can be stopped if a \fBstop\fP flag is encountered.

.IP \(bu 2
The optional trailing \fBi\fP (for \fIi\fPgnore case) means that the
string search operation should ignore the case for this pattern.

Small examples to explain the meaning of \fIv\fP:

.nf
\f(CBR=$(echo a b c | smenu -S /b/B/)\fP
.fi
will display \f(CR"a B c"\fP and \f(CBR\fP will contain \fIB\fP
when \fIB\fP is selected meanwhile

.nf
\f(CBR=$(echo a b c | smenu -S /b/B/\fBv\fP)\fR
.fi
will display the same as above but \f(CBR\fP will contain the original
word \fIb\fP when \fIB\fP is selected.

In both cases, only the word \fIB\fP will be searchable and not \fIb\fP.

Pre-processes words by applying a substitution based on a regular expression.
The argument must be formatted as in the \fBsed\fP editor.

The substitutions are made, as the name of the option indicates, before
any other selection or coloring actions are made.

This option can be used more than once.
Each substitution will be applied in sequence on each word.
This sequence can be stopped if a \fBstop\fP flag is encountered.

In summary, this option is similar to the \fB-S\fP|\fB-subst\fP option
previously described, except that the substitutions are made earlier and
certain flags like \fBvisual\fP are ignored.

Note that this option can be used in conjunction with the other
substitution options mentioned above.
.IP "\fB-/\fP|\fB-search_method\fP \fIsearch_method\fP"

Affects the '\fB/\fP' key to a search method.
By default '\fB/\fP' is affected to '\fIfuzzy\fP' but the argument can
be any prefix of '\fIprefix\fP', '\fIsubstring\fP' or '\fIfuzzy\fP'.
.IP "\fB-s\fP|\fB-sp\fP|\fB-start\fP|\fB-start_pattern\fP \fIpattern\fP"

Place the cursor on the first word corresponding to the specified pattern.

Note that although only the first matching word is highlighted,  all
matching words (if any) can be accessed using \fBn\fP/\fBs\fP/\fBSPACE\fP
and \fBN\fP/\fBS\fP keys as if they were the result of one of the
search actions.

These matching words can also be tagged at once if the tagging/pinning
function is activated.  See the "Tagging" section for more information.

\fBESC\fP can be used to disable navigation among matching words.

\fIpattern\fP can be:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
A \fB#\fP immediately followed by a \fBnumber\fP giving the initial
position of the cursor (counting from 0).

If the word at this position is excluded, then the first previous non
excluded word is selected if it exists, otherwise the first non excluded
word is selected.

If this number if greater than the number of words, the cursor will be
placed on the latest selectable position.
.IP \(bu 2
A single \fB#\fP or the string \fB#last\fP to set the initial
cursor position on the latest selectable word position.
.IP \(bu 2
A string starting with a \fB/\fP indicating that we want the cursor

.IP \(bu 2
A string starting with a \fB=\fP indicating than we want the cursor

\fBWarning\fP, when searching for a prefix or a regular expression, smenu
only looks for them after an eventual modification, so for example,

.IP "\fB-X\fP|\fB-htmout\fP|\fB-hidden_timeout\fP \fItype\fP [\fIword\fP]\
 \fIdelay\fP"

Sets a timeout.
Three types of timeout are possible:
.RS
.TP 10
current:
At the timeout, the word under the cursor and/or the tagged words are
sent to the standard output if the \fBENTER\fP key has been pressed
.TP 10
quit:
At the timeout, nothing is selected as if the \fBq\fP key has been pressed
.TP 10
word:
At the timeout, the word given after the type is selected.
Note that this word doesn't need to be part of the words coming from
the standard input.
.PP
Each type can be be shortened as a prefix of its full name ("cur" for
"current" of "q" for "quit" per example).

The delay must be set in seconds and cannot be greater than 99999 seconds.

The remaining time (in seconds) is added at the end of the message
displayed above the selection window and is updated in real time each
second.

Any key except \fBENTER\fP, \fBq\fP, \fBQ\fP and \fBCTRL\ C\fP resets
the timer to its initial value.

The \fB-X\fP|\fB-htmout\fP|\fB-hidden_timeout\fP version works like
\fB-x\fP|\fB-tmout\fP|\fB-timeout\fP but no periodic remaining messages
is displayed above the selection window.
.RE
.IP "\fB-r\fP|\fB-auto_validate\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Enables \fBENTER\fP to validate the selection even in search mode.
.IP "\fB-is\fP|\fB-incremental_search\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

By default, when a new search session is initiated, the current search
buffer is reset.
When this parameter is set, the next search will start where the last
search ended, except if \fBESC\fP was hit before.

This option instructs not to clean the previous search buffer each time
a new search session is started.
.IP "\fB-v\fP|\fB-vb\fP|\fB-visual_bell\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

By default, when searching, an alarm is produced by the terminal when
the user enters a character or makes a move which lead to no result or
to an error condition.
This argument make this beep visual by briefly showing the cursor.
.IP "\fB-Q\fP|\fB-ignore_quotes\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Using this option will remove the word grouping feature from single and
double quotes which will be considered normal characters.
For example: \f(CB"a b"\fP will be considered by smenu as two words
\fB"a\fP and \fBb"\fP and no more as a single word: \fBa b\fP.
.IP "\fB-lim\fP|\fB-limits\fP \fIlimit:value\fP..."
(Allowed in all contexts.)

This option gives the possibility to modify the default maximum number
of words or columns and the maximum permitted word length.

The specified values overload the default settings and/or the settings
given in the configuration files.

.RS
In order to do that, three sub-options can be used:
.IP \fBl\fP:value 2
to set the maximum word length allowed.
.IP \fBw\fP:value 2
to set the maximum number of words allowed.
.IP \fBc\fP:value 2
to set the maximum number of columns allowed.
.P
Several sub-options, separated by spaces, can be given after this option.
.RE

.IP "\fB-f\fP|\fB-forgotten_timeout\fP|\fB-global_timeout\fP \fItimeout\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

This option defines a global timeout in seconds.
The program will end without error after this period of inactivity.

This timer is reset to its initial value each time a key is pressed.

Its default value is "unlimited", but it can be changed by assigning a
number (in tenths of seconds) to the "forgotten" entry in the [timers]
section of the optional configuration file.
See the example in the configuration sub-section.

A \fItimeout\fP value equals to \fB0\fP explicitly disables this timer.
.IP "\fB-nm\fP|\fB-no_mouse\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

This option allows you to disable the mouse even if smenu can use it.
.IP "\fB-br\fP|\fB-buttons\fP|\fB-button_remapping\fP \fInew_button_1\fP \
\fInew_button_3\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

This option allows one to remap the mouse buttons.  The buttons are numbered
from 1 to 3 but as smenu only uses buttons 1 and 3, only two arguments
are required.

By example, the syntax \f(CR-br 3 1\fP will reverse the first (left)
and third (right?) buttons.

The default mapping is \f(CR1 3\fP.
.IP "\fB-dc\fP|\fB-dcd\fP|\fB-double_click\fP|\fB-double_click_delay\fP \
\fIdelay_in_ms\fP"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

This option allows one to set the double-click delay in the range of 100 ms
(1/10 second) to 500 ms (1/2 second).
The default delay of 150 ms (1/6.66 second) will be used if the given
value is out of range or invalid.

The double-click capability can also be disabled by setting
\fIdelay_in_ms\fP to \fB0\fP.

This setting is also configurable in a configuration file, see the
[mouse] section in the example in the configuration sub-section.
.IP "\fB-sb\fP|\fB-sbw\fP|\fB-show_blank_words\fP [\fIblank_char\fP]"
(Allowed in all contexts.)

Normally, blank words (words containing only space:.!fmt
s) are only kept in column mode.
When this option is present, these words are converted into a sequence
of \fIblank_char\fP (or underscore if the optional parameter is absent)
so that they are visible and not ignored when not in column mode.

\fIblank_char\fP must be printable but not a space nor a multibyte
character.

Note: These blank words remain blank even if they are now made
visible. They can still be excluded using \f(CB-e '\ '\fP
or \f(CB-e '[ ]'\fP per example.
.SH NOTES
If tabulators (\fI\\t\fP) are embedded in the input, there is no way
to replace them with the original number of spaces.
In this case use another filter (like \fIexpand\fR) to pre-process
the data.

.SH BUGS/LIMITATIONS
Some terminal emulators, those notably based on VTE version later than
0.35 (see https://github.com/GNOME/vte/commit/01380d), have a new feature
that gives them the possibility to wrap/unwrap already displayed lines
when resizing the window.

As far as I known, there is no terminfo entry to disable that.

On these types of terminals, the automatic re-display of the output of
smenu will be disturbed and some artifacts may appear on the screen if
the terminal window is resized.
